## Folder Structure

After creation, your project should look like this:

```
my-app/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
  src/
    assets/
      /css
      /gallery
    Components/
      App/
      Content/
      Gallery/
      imageViewer/
      Toolbar/
  utils/
  index.css
  index.js
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
